## Payment Application

### Project Description:
The project is developed as part of the Embedded Systems Professional Track offered by Udacity and EGFWD. It is implemented using the C programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.

### System Description:
The project focuses on the development of a payment system simulation, which emulates the functionality of a SALE transaction. The system comprises three main modules: Card, Terminal (ATM), and Server. Each module serves a specific purpose within the system.

#### 1-Card Module:
The Card Module is responsible for storing essential card data, including the Card Holder Name, Primary Account Number, and Card Expiry Date. This module acts as a virtual representation of the physical card.

#### 2-Terminal (ATM) Module:
The Terminal Module, also referred to as the ATM module, facilitates user interaction with the payment system. It handles user interfaces and performs various functions. The module stores the transaction date and validates whether the card is expired or valid. Additionally, it maintains the transaction amount and checks if it exceeds the maximum limit allowed for the ATM.

#### 3-Server Module:
The Server Module is responsible for authentication and account verification. It validates the user's account by checking if it is present within the server's database. Furthermore, the module checks the account's state (whether it is running or blocked) and determines if the account has a sufficient balance to allow for withdrawals.

#### 4-Application Module:
The Application Module plays a crucial role in the payment system simulation by serving as the entry point for the code execution and facilitating seamless integration between the Card, Terminal (ATM), and Server modules. Its primary responsibilities include system initialization, coordination of module interactions, and overall control of the application flow.
